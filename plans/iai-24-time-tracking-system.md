# IAI-24: Task Time Tracking System

## High-Level Overview

Build a comprehensive time tracking system that integrates with the existing TaskFlow Dashboard, enabling users to track time spent on tasks through start/stop timers, manual time entries, and detailed reporting capabilities. The system will provide productivity insights and maintain timer persistence across browser sessions.

## Mid-Level Overview

- **Timer Management**: Implement start/stop/pause timer functionality with real-time updates
- **Time Entry System**: Create manual time entry interface with descriptions and categorization
- **Data Persistence**: Implement local storage and session management for timer state
- **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrate time tracking components into existing task workflows
- **Reporting System**: Generate time reports with daily/weekly views and productivity metrics
- **Type Safety**: Extend existing TypeScript types to support time tracking data
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive unit and E2E test coverage for all functionality

## End State

Users will see:
- A timer widget on each task card with start/stop/pause controls
- A dedicated time tracking panel showing active timers and recent entries
- Manual time entry forms accessible from task detail pages
- Time tracking reports in the analytics section showing productivity metrics
- Persistent timer state that survives browser refreshes and session changes
- Integration with existing task management workflow without disrupting current UX

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
- **State Management**: Use React Context + useReducer for global timer state management
- **Persistence**: Leverage localStorage for timer persistence with backup to sessionStorage  
- **Time Calculations**: Implement precise time tracking using Date objects and intervals
- **Performance**: Use React.memo and useMemo for optimized re-renders of timer components

### Important Constraints
- **Single Active Timer**: Only one timer can be active at a time per user
- **Time Validation**: Prevent negative time entries and future date entries
- **Session Management**: Handle browser tab switching and page refreshes gracefully
- **Data Integrity**: Validate all time entries before saving to prevent corruption

### Dependencies and Requirements
- **Existing Components**: TaskList.tsx, TaskForm.tsx, and task detail pages
- **Type System**: Extend src/types/index.ts with time tracking interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Extend src/lib/data.ts for time entry persistence
- **UI Components**: Use existing Tailwind classes and Lucide icons for consistency

### Coding Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript strict mode patterns
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Maintain existing component structure with props interfaces
- Apply existing error handling and loading state patterns
- Follow accessibility guidelines for timer controls and time displays

## Context

This feature addresses a critical gap in the TaskFlow Dashboard by providing time tracking capabilities that many productivity-focused teams require. It's designed to work alongside the Smart Analytics feature (IAI-23) in a parallel development workflow, demonstrating Git worktree capabilities.

```

### 3. Global Timer Context

```
Create React Context and Provider for managing global timer state, ensuring only one timer runs at a time and state persists across components.
