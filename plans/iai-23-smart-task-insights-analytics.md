## Context

This feature represents the missing Smart Task Insights Analytics Panel that was intentionally left unimplemented in the TaskFlow Dashboard for live demonstration purposes. The analytics panel serves as the centerpiece for showcasing AI-assisted development capabilities, data visualization expertise, and complex feature development from scratch using Claude Code.

The feature directly addresses the need for data-driven task management by providing insights that help users and teams optimize their productivity, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about task prioritization and resource allocation.
